4,IMPROVING_CYBERSECURITY_AND_RESILIENCE_THROUGH_ACQUISITION.pdf,"The overlays should encompass realistic, risk-based controls that appropriately mitigate the risks for the type of acquisition and should define the minimum acceptable controls for any acquisition that is of a similar type."
4,IMPROVING_CYBERSECURITY_AND_RESILIENCE_THROUGH_ACQUISITION.pdf,"The overlays should not, as a general rule, incorporate standards directly into contracts and should avoid prescriptive mandates for specific practices, tooling, or country-specific standards, because the inflexibility ofthose approaches often inadvertently increases costs without actually reducing risk."
4,IMPROVING_CYBERSECURITY_AND_RESILIENCE_THROUGH_ACQUISITION.pdf,"Instead, the overlays should specifically identify security controls from within standards that should be applied to the type of acquisition being conducted."
4,IMPROVING_CYBERSECURITY_AND_RESILIENCE_THROUGH_ACQUISITION.pdf,The overlays should also include acquisition and contractual controls like source selection criteria and contract performance measures.
4,IMPROVING_CYBERSECURITY_AND_RESILIENCE_THROUGH_ACQUISITION.pdf,"Finally, to the greatest extent possible, the overlays should be expressed as technical requirements."
4,IMPROVING_CYBERSECURITY_AND_RESILIENCE_THROUGH_ACQUISITION.pdf,The QBLs should be based on the cyber risk mitigation value provided by the use ofthe trusted source.
4,IMPROVING_CYBERSECURITY_AND_RESILIENCE_THROUGH_ACQUISITION.pdf,This approach also represents a limitation of available sources and therefore should only be used for types of acquisition that present risks great enough to justifythe negative impact on competition or price differences between trusted and un-trusted sources.
4,IMPROVING_CYBERSECURITY_AND_RESILIENCE_THROUGH_ACQUISITION.pdf,"For acquisitions that present these types of risks, the government should limit sources to OEMs,
authorized resellers and trusted suppliers, and the qualification should be incorporated into the
full acquisition and sustainment life cycles, starting with requirements definition, acquisition
planning, and market research."

23,CSC-Final-Report,"The strategy should clearly express that defend 
forward is an integral part of a comprehensive approach 
that encompasses all of the instruments of national power 
beyond the employment of strictly military capabilities; 
these include trade and economic efforts, law enforce-
ment activities, and diplomatic tools."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"To induce adversaries to change their behavior, the 
United States must create costs below the threshold 
at which the full spectrum of credible retaliatory 
response options may be triggered"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"In doing so, the 
United States must ensure that effective policies and 
processes are in place to guide such actions consistent 
with the rule of law and adequate risk assessments."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Finally, the National Cyber Strategy should articulate 
a framework for how the U.S. government should put 
the approach into operation that is organized around six 
pillars"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Therefore, the U.S. government should develop a mul-
titiered signaling strategy aimed at altering adversaries’ 
decision calculus and addressing risks of escalation"
23,CSC-Final-Report," The strategic level of signaling should involve overt, 
public diplomatic signaling through traditional 
mechanisms that have already been established for 
other domains, as well as private diplomatic com-
munications through mechanisms such as hotlines 
and other nonpublic channels"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"The operational and tactical levels should involve 
clandestine, protected, and covert signaling (includ-
ing through non-cyber means) that is deliberately 
coupled with cyber operations."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"A signaling strategy should also include a framework to 
guide when and under what conditions the U.S. govern-
ment will voluntarily self-attribute cyber operations and 
campaigns for the purposes of signaling capability and 
intent to various audiences"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Therefore, the U.S. 
government should promulgate a new declaratory 
policy around a use-of-force threshold."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Specifically, 
the U.S. government should publicly convey that it 
will respond using swift, costly, and, where possible, 
transparent consequences against cyber activities that 
constitute what the United States defines as a use of 
force."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"the U.S. government should announce 
a second declaratory policy. This policy should 
clearly state that the United States will respond 
using cyber and non-cyber capabilities to counter 
and impose costs against adversary cyber campaigns 
below a use-of-force threshold."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Essentially, the U.S. government should publicly 
declare that it will defend forward, and couple its 
declaration with decisive and consistent action 
across all elements of national power."
23,CSC-Final-Report," Congress should create House Permanent Select and Senate Select Committees on 
Cybersecurity to consolidate budgetary and legislative jurisdiction over cybersecurity issues, as 
well as traditional oversight authority"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"the 
Commission recommends establishing a Permanent 
Select Committee on Cybersecurity in the House and a 
Select Committee on Cybersecurity in the Senate."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"like the Select Committees on Intelligence, 
these committees should have a membership structure 
designed to encourage cross-committee collaboration and the sharing of best practices. "
23,CSC-Final-Report,"The final committee 
composition should be proportionate to each party’s 
composition of the House, and one more seat given to 
the majority party in the Senate; to promote institutional 
knowledge, committee members should be exempt from 
any term limits."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should reestablish and fund the Office of 
Technology Assessment (OTA), or another similar 
agency, to advise both chambers on cyber and technol-
ogy policy issues."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should establish a National Cyber Director (NCD), within the Executive Ofﬁce of the 
President, who is Senate-conﬁrmed and supported by the Ofﬁce of the National Cyber Director. "
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should strengthen the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in 
its mission to ensure national resilience of critical infrastructure, to promote a more secure cyber 
ecosystem, and to serve as the central civilian cybersecurity authority to support federal, state 
and local, and private-sector cybersecurity efforts"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should give the 
Director of CISA a five-year term and elevate the position 
to level II of the Executive Schedule, or equivalent to 
a Deputy Secretary and to Military Service Secretaries. 
Congress should also consider making the posts of 
Assistant Director career positions to provide greater 
consistency and continuity."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should increase 
CISA’s funding for administrative and programs support, 
so that it can enhance current operations and transition 
from being a headquarters element to an operational 
agency within DHS. "
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should review CISA’s budget 
and consider giving proportionally greater resources to 
projects and programs intended to support private-sector 
cybersecurity, to promote public-private integration, and 
to increase situational awareness of threat."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress 
should consider providing stable multiyear funding to 
ensure the flexibility necessary to build lasting analytical 
capability across multiple budget years."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"n developing the resources and 
support model, the executive branch and Congress 
should examine current CISA facilities and assess 
their suitability to fully support current and projected 
mission requirements nationally and regionally. "
23,CSC-Final-Report,"The 
General Services Administration should provide a report 
to Congress including recommendations for further resources to procure or build a new facility or augment

goals of this report. "
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress and the 
U.S. government should strengthen CISA’s ability to aid 
the public and private sectors in recovering from a sig-

action"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should increase 
government support to systemically important critical 
infrastructure (recommendation 5.1), establish and fund 
a Joint Collaborative Environment (recommendation 
5.2), increase integration among federal cyber centers and 
CISA (recommendation 5.3), and establish a Joint Cyber 
Planning Cell (recommendation 5.4). "
23,CSC-Final-Report,"The Secretary of 
Homeland Security should establish a Cybersecurity 
Advisory Committee to advise, consult, and make 
recommendations to CISA on policies, programs, and 
rulemakings, among other items, to account for non-fed-

23,CSC-Final-Report,"The committee should be exempt from 
the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act and be composed of state, local, and private-sector representatives from across the 16 critical infrastructure 
sectors. "
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should strengthen 
CISA’s ability to conduct continuous threat hunting 
across .gov networks, which will enhance CISA’s ability to 
both protect federal civilian networks and provide useful 
threat intelligence to critical infrastructure"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Codify and Strengthen the Cyber 
Threat Intelligence Integration Center"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"To ensure adequate resources, Congress should codify 
and establish CTIIC through legislation, using as a 
model the 2015 Presidential Memorandum that created 
the center, and strengthen CTIIC’s ability to carry out its responsibilities, especially in enhancing the quality and 
speed of attribution"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should appropriate the resources necessary 
for CTIIC to carry out all mission areas enumerated 
in the 2015 Presidential Memorandum"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Congress should appropriate all necessary funds to 
ensure that CTIIC can reliably provide reimburse-

bution of goods and services necessary for the reliable 
economic functioning of the United States"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"Leveraging 
work on the national critical functions already in devel-

cyber center within CISA in support of the critical 
infrastructure cybersecurity and resilience mission and in 
coordination with centers in the FBI, ODNI, and DoD."
23,CSC-Final-Report,"While this is under way, the executive branch should 
conduct a one-year, comprehensive systems analysis 
review of federal cyber and cybersecurity centers, which 
should include developing plans to better integrate

23,CSC-Final-Report,"the review should identify challenges and 
solutions to more effectively integrate elements of federal 
cyber centers, the private sector, and CISA with a view 
toward reinforcing human-to-human collaboration, 
reducing procedural or technical barriers to integration, 
implementing other recommendations within this report,

Director, a working group led by DHS, in coordination 
with DoD, DOJ, FBI, and ODNI. "
23,CSC-Final-Report,"In strengthening a public-private integrated 
cyber center within CISA, the executive branch should 
identify continuing gaps and shortcomings in CISA’s 
current capacity, structure, funding, and integration of its work with sector-specific agencies that prevent it 
from fulfilling its role as the central coordinator among 
federal centers for critical infrastructure cybersecurity and 
resilience"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"The 
executive branch should assess areas where existing federal 
cyber centers, or portions of a center’s mission, would 
benefit from greater integration or collocation to support 
cybersecurity collaboration with critical infrastructure. "
23,CSC-Final-Report,"The review should identify and acknowledge continuing 
gaps and shortcomings in associated capacity and funding 
of the FBI and ODNI, identify methods to better 
integrate efforts with CISA in support of its mission to 
ensure the security and resilience of critical infrastructure, 
and identify where federal agencies have distinct statutory 
authorities (i.e., those of law enforcement, counterintel-
ligence, military, and intelligence operations) best kept 
distinct and separate from these efforts"

integrated cyber center within CISA should be similarly organized into two environments: an unclassified side, 
which handles general cybersecurity coordination and 
cooperation with the private sector, and a classified 
side with appropriate support from CSD, which han-
dles deeper collaboration with systemically important 
critical infrastructure and the intelligence community 
on systemic cyber security and resilience and cyber 
defense operations"
23,CSC-Final-Report,"The executive branch should assess 
continuing gaps and limitations in its ability to provide 
for greater centralization of public-private cybersecurity 
efforts similar to the NCSC model within a CISA inte-
