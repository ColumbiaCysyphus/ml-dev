              " 'In fact, the latest “IT Leadership Survey” from the Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) identified the following top three priorities and challenges for school district IT leaders: Mobile learning Broadband and network capacity Cybersecurity and student data privacy As such, throughout this report, the reader should keep the following minimum considerations of recognized best practices and industry trends in mind.',\n",

              " 'As school districts move toward cloud-based solutions for instructional and business applications, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and other related privacy rules and regulations add a layer of complexity to network implementation.',\n",

              " 'With so much focus on securing technology, it can be easy to overlook the interrelationship between physical security and cybersecurity, but one of the success stories provided by the Fresno Unified School District shows that close monitoring of network and content security tools can help children in need.',\n",
              " 'Network Security — Network security is focused on ensuring there isn’t any unauthorized traffic flowing across the network, that no one is abusing or gaining illegitimate access to network-connected resources and that sensitive information is secured while it is traversing the network (data in motion).',\n",

              " 'Many organizations combine content security and application security into a single process, but as software development projects in K-become more sophisticated, and different teams work on the data layer and application tiers, thinking of content and application security separately can be helpful in ensuring a positive overall security posture.',\n",
